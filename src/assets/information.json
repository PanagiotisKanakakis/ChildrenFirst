      "answer": "According to OHCHR, \"a gender stereotype is a generalised view or preconception about attributes or characteristics, or the roles that are or ought to be possessed by, or performed by women and men. A gender stereotype is harmful when it limits women’s and men’s capacity to develop their personal abilities, pursue their professional careers and make choices about their lives. Harmful stereotypes can be hostile/negative (e.g.women are irrational) or seemingly benign (e.g.women are nurturing)\" , and hence, contribute in shaping one's gender role within a society. When this becomes a practice it can result in a violation of human rights."
