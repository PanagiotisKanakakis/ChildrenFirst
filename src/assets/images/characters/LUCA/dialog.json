Moreover, the widespread machismo and culture of masculinity in which we live could make violent behaviour against men (such a slap!) more acceptable in the society.\nDon’t be afraid of breaking these stereotypes and to speak up. \nIt’s not by accepting violence that you will be more of a man!\n"

      "feedback": "Violence against men is still a taboo topic, mostly because of the stereotypes about men and masculinity, which end up reinforcing gender-based violence and making violent behaviour from men more acceptable in the society. However, you should keep in mind that a slap is always a slap, that controlling the partners’ phone, or forcing them to do something against their will, is always a limitation of freedom. \nThese are all forms of violence, not signs of love. So, let’s fight to live healthy love!\n"
