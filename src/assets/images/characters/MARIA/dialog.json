It can be physical, sexual and/or psychological, and includes a) violence in close relationships, b) sexual violence (including rape, sexual assault and harassment or stalking), c) slavery, d) harmful practices (i.e., forced marriages, female genital mutilation and ‘honour’ crimes) e) cyberviolence and harassment using new technologies."

      "feedback": "Jealousy and control over partners is not a sign of love! Doubting about everything you say and asking for proofs; asking to check your phone or to send your localisation or photos; forbidding to go out with friends or to wear what you like the most… these are all alarming signals which should never be underestimated or seen as “normal”. A healthy relationship is made up of mutual understanding, respect and protection of the other’s spaces. If you feel that these elements are lacking in your relationship, you should rethink what makes you happy. And do not hesitate to ask for help or advice!\n\nDating violence is violence often observed by children/teens whilst dating, prior and during becoming adolescents and forming long-term relationships. It is defined as violence that has a serious and long lasting impact on the mental health of teenagers and the future views they have about romantic relationships."
