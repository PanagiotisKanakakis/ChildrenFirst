  "storyDescription": "Amelia is a new girl in class. She moved to a rural area from the capital city after her parents changed jobs and now she started to go to a new school. Amelia loves arts and fashion. She is very comfortable in her own skin, loves her body and loves to wear colourful clothes, usually short skirts and dresses as she thinks they fit her best. She mostly hangs with boys as girls never liked her. Girls in her class think she is too “out there” and “easy going” because of the way she dresses and avoid talking to her, except Ann with whom they clicked right away. One Friday Amelia’s friend Tim (18), who attends the same school, invites her to his birthday party in his grandparent’s summer house. Amelia is happy as Tim was one of the first people to give her a warm welcome to the new school, he also loves to play piano. During the party, Amelia is having loads of fun, she is bonding and dancing with her male friends, especially Tim, who is an amazing dancer. They all have a great laugh, have some cider and beer together."
