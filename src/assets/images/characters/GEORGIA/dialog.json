The intervention of an adult may be crucial for reporting the perpetrator and ensure the victim’s wellbeing. However, Georgia’s parents seem not supportive at all on this, being more focused on the shame she brought upon the family. As a consequence, she retreated into himself and repressed all her feelings.\nWhen people you love don’t understand you on such important matters, all your efforts should be placed in communicating your feelings and thoughts, in a calm and constructive way. People may be victims of stereotypes and norms imposed on the ‘appropriate’ behaviour of men and women, which are still common in our societies. However, you should never reject who you are in order to make them feel better.\n"

However, still much has to be done in terms of empowerment and communication, in order to have them supportive of your personal choices and protective with regards to what happened to you.\nIt is a hard trip and this takes time, but you are on your way for happiness!\n",

In recent years, it is growing among people of all ages and sexual orientation, but especially among teenagers. Like many other youngsters, Georgia was not aware of the dangers of sending explicit images of her, nor was informed about the consequences of being a victim of revenge porn. \nHopefully, her efforts in asking for his parents help will allow her to work on this unlucky event, to be more aware of the internet’s risks, and most importantly in building a more communicative relationship with his parents.\nBe patient, never stop self-reflecting and chasing your happiness ;)\n"
