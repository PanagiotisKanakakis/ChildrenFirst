  "characterDescription": "Mimi is 15 years old and comes from a conservative family where dating is seen as a taboo and is frowned upon in her family environment. Mimi has always focused on her studies and has never been interested in relationship as her parents have always told her that studies are more important. Things start to change when she meets Jack a 17-year-old boy older than her. For the next three months she starts to date Jack in secret without any members of her family knowing. After those three months, things start to change as Jack start to act weirdly making Mimi feel concerned.",
  "storyDescription": "Jack becomes a little more obsessive over her and interested in what she does during her free time. He would call her at random times just to see what she was doing and who she is with. He would even turn up at the places she is hanging out in and spend the rest of the day with her. At first Mimi believed that this was just innocent but started becoming more and more concerned when she found him lurking around her home. When her parents left, he would always knock on her door, she would always ignore the doorbell and pretend not be at home. Things start to change when Mimiâ€™s mother starts to notice Jack quite often hanging around in the road. She also starts to notice behavioural changes in Mimi such as changing phone numbers, closed curtains, and lack of communication. In this instance her parents decided to sit Mimi down and discuss with her what is happening."
