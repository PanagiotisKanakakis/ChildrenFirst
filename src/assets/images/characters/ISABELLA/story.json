  "storyDescription": "For as long as she can remember, Isabella was never satisfied with the way she looked. She wanted to have long shiny hair and be as slim as those fabulous girls she saw in magazines. Isabella is quite calm and shy. Her classmates are bullying her for wearing glasses and being low profile. Some boys at her class are mocking her for having bodily matured from her age as the rest of the girls have not yet. They call her names and provoke her. One year ago, Isabella met John, a new classmate that moved to her village from a capital city. He was so different from other boys she knew, who always called her “fat cow” “chubby” etc. He showed a lot of attention to her and expressed how he admired her wonderful “womanly” figure. Isabella felt special as someone finally appreciated her looks, nevertheless she still tried to lose some weight, as she was afraid to get diabetes as her mother. She could never tell that to John, as he clearly stated that he will make sure she would stay “womanly” and not go after diets as those “skinny hangers” he hates. "
