      "feedback": "As Anna’s mum was saying, control over partners is not a sign of love! Doubting about everything you say and asking for proofs; asking to check your phone or to send your localisation or photos; forbidding to go out with friends or to wear what you like the most… these are all alarming signals which should never be underestimated or seen as “normal”. A healthy relationship is made up of mutual understanding, respect and protection of the other’s spaces. If you feel that these elements lack in your relationship, you should rethink about what makes you happy. And do not hesitate to ask for help or advice!"
