Iman is 14 years old and he is a second-generation immigrant from Syria. He comes from a conservative family and is the youngest of his four siblings. Although Iman’s level in Greek language is satisfactory, he has not yet been able to establish substantial friendships with other Greek-speaking students. He, along with the rest of the refugee children, is marginalized by the students’ community because of his nationality. Nevertheless, he enjoys playing football and is also a very good runner. Iman is gay but because of his conservative family background and discrimination he has been facing as a Syrian in a Greek school, he decided to hide his sexuality. He is afraid that his sexuality will upset his family, drive his friends away and make him the laughing stock of the whole school.
