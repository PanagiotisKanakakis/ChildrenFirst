GBV has various forms; psychological, verbal, and physical violence. Moreover, the widespread machismo and culture of masculinity in which we live could make violent behaviour against men more acceptable in society.\nDo not be afraid of breaking these stereotypes and to speak up. Do not accept any form of violence and embrace your sexuality! Having a different sexual orientation does not make you abnormal and does not justify any form of violence.\n"
