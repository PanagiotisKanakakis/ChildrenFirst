Cristian is a 16 year-old boy coming from a very religious family, forced since his childhood to live a life where faith is the only important thing. For this reason, he has never been used to having friends, during high school he feels lonely, sometimes he isolates himself because he feels ashamed. He does not have a computer nor a phone, until his 16th birthday when he got a smartphone as a present from a family friend. He starts spending most of his time at home on his phone like many teenagers do. One day he meets someone online called Joe who is also 16. Joe lives in London and has an exciting lifestyle travelling the world with his parents. Christian starts to fancy Joe both being attracted to his wealth and personality; he would like to date him so starts to send Joe some personal and intimate photos as a way of showing affection. Christian notices that when he sends those photos through apps such as snapchat, Joe saves them but doesn&#39;t return the favour making him worried and confused. He doesnâ€™t really understand his behaviour and sees it as a normal thing, having missed all school classes about online safety.
